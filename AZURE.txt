WEEK 1 ON THE COURSE ------>                                        FUNDEMENTALS OF AZURE 






                            I have been introduced to fundamental Azure topics by Mukesh SIR
We have 
1.	Azure Fundamentals
2.	Compute service
3.	Network services
4.	Inbound and Outbound rule creations
5.	 IAM and Security monitoring 
6.	 RBAC - role base access control

And here I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SERVICES
 
1.	Azure Fundamentals â€“ Azure is a cloud computing platform and service offered by Microsoft. It provides a wide range of cloud-based services, including computing, storage, databases, machine learning, and more. Azure allows businesses and individuals to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

2.	Compute service-In the compute service we can deploy virtual machine applications workloads and wide range of options for compute resources and capabilities.

3.	Network services- Connect manage virtual machines and monitor gateway protocols and we have fire wall monitor control load balancer and monitor them.

4.	Inbound and Outbound rule creations- Creating inbound and outbound rules in Azure typically refers to setting up network security rules for controlling the traffic to and from virtual machines (VMs) or resources in an Azure Virtual Network.
 
5.	IAM and Security monitoring - IAM in Azure is all about controlling who has access to your resources and what they can do with those resources. Azure provides robust IAM capabilities through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

6. RBAC - role base access control- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure is a fundamental component of Azure's identity and access management system. RBAC allows you to control access to Azure resources.
 

WEEK 2 ON THE COUSE -------->                         AZURE  VIRTUAL MASHINE FEATURES 



                    AZURE VIRTUAL MACHINES (VMS) ARE ON-DEMAND, SCALABLE COMPUTING RESOURCES PROVIDED BY MICROSOFT AZURE. 
WHEN YOU CREATE AN AZURE VM, YOU CAN CONFIGURE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS NETWORKING TO SUIT YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
HERE ARE SOME KEY AZURE VM NETWORK FEATURES


VIRTUAL NETWORK (VNET): AZURE VMS ARE TYPICALLY DEPLOYED WITHIN A VIRTUAL NETWORK (VNET). VNETS ALLOW YOU TO CREATE ISOLATED NETWORK SEGMENTS FOR YOUR RESOURCES AND CONTROL THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. YOU CAN CREATE CUSTOM VNETS TO MEET YOUR NETWORK SEGMENTATION NEEDS.

NETWORK SECURITY GROUPS
(NSG): NSGS ACT AS A BASIC FIREWALL FOR CONTROLLING INBOUND AND OUTBOUND TRAFFIC TO AND FROM AZURE VMS. YOU CAN DEFINE RULES TO PERMIT OR DENY SPECIFIC TRAFFIC BASED ON SOURCE AND DESTINATION IP ADDRESSES, PORT RANGES, AND PROTOCOLS.

PUBLIC IP ADDRESSES: AZURE VMS CAN HAVE PUBLIC IP ADDRESSES FOR INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. YOU CAN ASSOCIATE A PUBLIC IP ADDRESS WITH A VM TO ENABLE COMMUNICATION OVER THE PUBLIC INTERNET. ALTERNATIVELY, YOU CAN USE AZURE LOAD BALANCER TO DISTRIBUTE TRAFFIC TO A POOL OF VMS.

PRIVATE IP ADDRESSES: AZURE VMS ARE ASSIGNED PRIVATE IP ADDRESSES FROM THE ADDRESS SPACE OF THE VNET TO WHICH THEY BELONG. THESE PRIVATE IPS ARE USED FOR COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE VNET OR WITH OTHER RESOURCES CONNECTED TO THE SAME VNET.

NETWORK SECURITY AND VPN GATEWAY: AZURE OFFERS NETWORK SECURITY AND VPN GATEWAYS TO ESTABLISH SECURE CONNECTIONS TO YOUR ON-PREMISES NETWORK. YOU CAN SET UP SITE-TO-SITE (S2S) OR POINT-TO-SITE (P2S) VPN CONNECTIONS, OR USE AZURE EXPRESSROUTE FOR DEDICATED, PRIVATE CONNECTIVITY.



    WEEK 3 ON THE COURSE   ----------->                       AZURE FIREWALL, NETWORK SECURITY GROUP, NETWORK TRAFFIC AND SENTINEL


                              AZURE FIREWALL IS A CLOUD-BASED, MANAGED NETWORK SECURITY SERVICE PROVIDED BY MICROSOFT AZURE. IT ACTS AS A CENTRALIZED, HIGHLY AVAILABLE FIREWALL-AS-A-SERVICE FOR SECURING YOUR VIRTUAL NETWORK RESOURCES. 

AZURE FIREWALL IS A STATEFUL FIREWALL THAT INSPECTS AND FILTERS TRAFFIC AT THE NETWORK AND APPLICATION LAYER, PROVIDING PROTECTION AGAINST NETWORK THREATS, APPLICATION LAYER ATTACKS, AND UNWANTED NETWORK TRAFFIC.
    OUTBOUND: AZURE FIREWALL ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL OUTBOUND INTERNET ACCESS FOR RESOURCES IN YOUR VNET, ENSURING THAT ONLY AUTHORIZED TRAFFIC IS ALLOWED TO ACCESS THE INTERNET.
    INBOUND: YOU CAN USE AZURE FIREWALL TO PUBLISH AND PROTECT APPLICATIONS BY CONFIGURING NETWORK RULES AND APPLICATION RULES FOR INBOUND TRAFFIC.


A NETWORK SECURITY GROUP (NSG) IS A FUNDAMENTAL NETWORKING SECURITY FEATURE IN MICROSOFT AZURE THAT ACTS AS A BASIC FIREWALL FOR CONTROLLING INBOUND AND OUTBOUND TRAFFIC TO AND FROM AZURE RESOURCES. 
NSGS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NETWORK INTERFACES, VIRTUAL MACHINES (VMS), AND SUBNETS, AND THEY ALLOW YOU TO DEFINE RULES THAT PERMIT OR DENY SPECIFIC TRAFFIC BASED ON SOURCE AND DESTINATION IP ADDRESSES, PORT RANGES


AZURE SENTINEL IS A CLOUD-NATIVE SECURITY INFORMATION AND EVENT MANAGEMENT (SIEM) AND SECURITY ORCHESTRATION, AUTOMATION, AND RESPONSE (SOAR) SOLUTION OFFERED BY MICROSOFT AZURE. IT IS DESIGNED TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS DETECT, 
INVESTIGATE, AND RESPOND TO SECURITY THREATS AND INCIDENTS ACROSS THEIR ENTIRE CLOUD AND ON-PREMISES INFRASTRUCTURE.
ADVANCED ANALYTICS: AZURE SENTINEL USES ADVANCED ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING TO IDENTIFY AND CORRELATE SECURITY EVENTS AND ANOMALIES, HELPING SECURITY TEAMS DETECT THREATS MORE EFFECTIVELY.

CUSTOM DETECTION RULES: YOU CAN CREATE CUSTOM DETECTION RULES AND ALERTS BASED ON YOUR ORGANIZATION'S SPECIFIC SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. THESE RULES CAN BE TAILORED TO YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND THREAT LANDSCAPE.

INCIDENT MANAGEMENT: AZURE SENTINEL PROVIDES A CENTRALIZED INCIDENT MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD THAT ALLOWS SECURITY TEAMS TO INVESTIGATE AND MANAGE SECURITY INCIDENTS EFFICIENTLY. IT HELPS STREAMLINE INCIDENT WORKFLOWS AND RESPONSE PROCESSES.

AUTOMATION AND ORCHESTRATION: AZURE SENTINEL INCLUDES AUTOMATED RESPONSE CAPABILITIES THAT ALLOW YOU TO DEFINE PLAYBOOKS FOR SPECIFIC INCIDENT RESPONSE ACTIONS. THESE PLAYBOOKS CAN AUTOMATE TASKS LIKE ISOLATING COMPROMISED MACHINES OR BLOCKING MALICIOUS IPS.

WEEK 4 ON THE COURSE    --------------->                             WAZUH DEPLOYMENT IN UBUNTU AZURE MACHINE AND ADDING AZURE VIRTUAL MACHINE AS AGENTS


  WAZUH IS AN OPEN-SOURCE SECURITY MONITORING PLATFORM THAT CAN BE USED FOR INTRUSION DETECTION, VULNERABILITY DETECTION, AND LOG ANALYSIS.
DEPLOYING WAZUH INVOLVES SEVERAL STEPS TO SET UP THE SERVER AND AGENTS TO MONITOR YOUR SYSTEMS. HERE'S A HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE DEPLOYMENT PROCESS




SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
Ensure you have a dedicated server for the Wazuh manager. You can deploy Wazuh on a physical server, a virtual machine, or in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

OPERATING SYSTEM:
Choose a compatible operating system. Wazuh supports various Linux distributions, including CentOS, Ubuntu, and Red Hat.

INSTALLATION:
Install the Wazuh manager on the dedicated server. This typically involves adding the Wazuh repository, installing the Wazuh manager package, and starting the service.

WAZUH MANAGER CONFIGURATION:
Configure the Wazuh manager settings, such as API access, email alerts, and integration with other security tools.

ELASTIC STACK INTEGRATION (OPTIONAL):
Wazuh can be integrated with the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for more advanced data analysis and visualization. You can follow specific guidelines for integrating Wazuh with the Elastic Stack.

AGENT INSTALLATION:
Install Wazuh agents on the servers you want to monitor. Agents are responsible for collecting and forwarding data to the Wazuh manager.

AGENT REGISTRATION:
Register the agents with the Wazuh manager by providing the manager's IP address and a registration key. Agents will then start sending data to the manager.

RULE CUSTOMIZATION:
Customize Wazuh rules to fit your environment and specific security requirements. You can modify existing rules or create new ones.
